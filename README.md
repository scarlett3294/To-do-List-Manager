#### Description:
The To-Do List Manager is a versatile Python program designed to help you stay organized by managing your to-do list digitally. It offers a simple yet powerful interface through the command line, enabling you to add tasks, mark them as completed, remove tasks, view task statuses, and export your tasks to a CSV file for easy tracking and record-keeping.

#### How It Works:

Adding Tasks: You can quickly add tasks to your to-do list by selecting option 1 and providing a task description. The program stores tasks in a list, keeping track of their completion status.

Completing Tasks: To mark a task as completed, choose option 2. You'll see a list of your tasks, and you can select the task you want to mark as completed. The program updates the task's status accordingly.

Removing Tasks: If you decide to remove a task, select option 3. You'll see a list of tasks and can choose the one you wish to remove. If the task is still pending, the program will confirm your decision to remove it.

Listing Tasks: Options 4, 5, and 6 allow you to list your tasks. Option 4 displays all tasks, along with their statuses (completed or pending). Option 5 lists only pending tasks, and option 6 lists completed tasks.

Exporting to CSV: Option 7 allows you to export your tasks to a CSV file. This feature generates a CSV file named "tasks.csv," containing all your tasks and their statuses. It's a valuable tool for tracking your task history or sharing your to-do list with others.

Quitting: You can exit the To-Do List Manager at any time by choosing option 8. This will gracefully end the program.
